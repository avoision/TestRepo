Dryer
by Felix Jung

Small wonder I envision love when
I hear the sweaters and the shirts 
tumbling into one another's arms. 

The buzzer sings. I crack the door
and feel a warmth that reaches out 
to me. I think how, over time, our

bodies cool and lose the heat once 
given them. I tug their arms. I grab 
them all and hold them to my chest.
